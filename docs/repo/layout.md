## Project Layout

This repository contains several Rust crates that implement the different building blocks of an Conflux node. The high-level structure of the repository is as follows:

- [bins](../../bins): All binary crates located in this folder
- [crates](../../crates): All crates library
- [internal_contract](../../internal_contract): Internal contracts's abi and interface
- [tests](../../tests): The python integration tests
- [run](../../run): Node run misc, include default config file and start scripts
- [dev-support](../../dev-support): Dev support scripts
- [docs](../../docs): Documentation
- [changelogs](../../changelogs): Changelogs, especially for the JSON-RPC APIs

## Crates

### binaries

The bins directory contains some binary crates:

- conflux: The conflux binary program, which serves as both the node's startup program and a CLI tool. It can be used for account management, calling RPC interfaces, etc.
- cfx_store: A tool for managing accounts.
- cfx_key: A conflux account key generation tool.
- pos-genesis-tool: A tool for generating PoS genesis data.

### basic crates

- [cfx_bytes](../../crates/cfx_bytes): Provides some general byte manipulation functions.
- [cfx_types](../../crates/cfx_types):Provides some commonly used type definitions in blockchain, such as Address, U256, H256, etc.
- [cfx_addr](../../crates/cfx_addr): Conflux base32 address encoding/decoding.

### primitives

The [primitives crate](../../crates/primitives) contains the core data structures used in the Conflux system. For example, block, transaction, and receipt. This crate forms the foundational data structures of the entire Conflux system.

### cfxcore

The Conflux Protocol's core code located at [cfxcore](../../crates/cfxcore) directory. Including `consensus`, `EVM machine` etc.

### dbs

The [dbs](../../crates/dbs) directory contains the database crates.

### network

The [network](../../crates/network) directory contains the network crate.

### client

The [client](../../crates/client) crate contains the client startup logic and the Core Space RPC implementation.

### RPC

Conflux provides a standard JSON-RPC 2.0 interface to allow external ecosystems (SDKs, wallets, etc.) to interact with the blockchain. Conflux includes two spaces: Core Space and eSpace, each with its own RPC.

The RPC implementation for eSpace is mainly located in the [crates/rpc](crates/rpc) directory and is developed using the [jsonrpsee](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee) RPC framework. It includes multiple crates:

- [rpc-primitives](../../crates/rpc/rpc-primitives/): Definitions of the raw types for RPC.
- [rpc-cfx-types](../../crates/rpc/rpc-cfx-types/): RPC type definitions for Core Space.
- [rpc-eth-types](../../crates/rpc/rpc-eth-types/): RPC type definitions for eSpace.
- [rpc-eth-api](../../crates/rpc/rpc-eth-api/): RPC interface definitions for eSpace, organized by namespace.
- [rpc](../../crates/rpc/rpc/): RPC interface implementation for eSpace.
- [rpc-builder](../../crates/rpc/rpc-builder/): Logic for RPC interface registration and service startup.
- [rpc-utils](../../crates/rpc/rpc-utils/): Implementation of common utilities, such as error code definitions.

The RPC implementation for Core Space is located in the [crates/client](../../crates/client) crate, developed using [jsonrpc-core](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpc)e. The core code is in the src/rpc directory.

### Stratum

Conflux uses the industry-standard `Stratum protocol` for implementing PoW mining. The protocol implementation code is primarily located in the [crates/stratum](../../crates/stratum) and [crates/blockgen](../../crates/blockgen) directories. Additionally, there is some related code in the `crates/cfxcore/core/src/pow/mod.rs` file.

### util

The [util](../../crates/util) directory contains some general utility crates.
