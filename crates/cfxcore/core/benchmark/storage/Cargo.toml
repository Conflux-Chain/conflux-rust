[patch.'https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum']
# The upstream ethkey uses the master branch of rust-secp256k1,
# causing conflicts between different versions of rand.
# Patch doesn't seem to work since the package name of rust-secp256k1 has changed,
# Cargo thinks it's an error in Cargo.toml of ethkey before considering the patch.
# The only solution is to patch ethkey.
# However it also doesn't work because in its Cargo.toml the package is defined by
# the git path, so the only possible place to patch is inside the git path.
#eth-secp256k1 = { package = "parity-secp256k1", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/rust-secp256k1" }
# The current version doesn't work because of upgrades.
#ethkey = { path = "../../../accounts/ethkey" }
# This also don't work because cargo scans the whole git and aborted due to lack of Cargo.toml in one dir.
