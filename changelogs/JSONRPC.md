# JSON-RPC CHANGELOG

## v2.4.1

1. eSpace add new RPC method `eth_getBlockReceipts`
2. RPC method `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`'s Transaction object add a new field `input` to keep compatibility with Ethereum.
3. eSpace `block` and `transaction` object field value changed: `block.transactionsRoot(when tx is empty)`, `block.receiptsRoot(when tx is empty)`, `post-155 tx.v`, `phantom tx.r, tx.s`.
4. Core Space local RPC method `cfx_sendTransaction` and `cfx_signTransaction` support `2930&1559` type transactions.
5. Optimize method name of test and debug namespace, add `test` and `debug` prefix, change name from underscore style to camel style eg `current_sync_phase` -> `debug_currentSyncPhase`.
6. eth_call, eth_estimateGas improve compatible with solidity custom revert error.
7. Update both core and eSpace block gas limit to return real available gas limit. The core space block size is 9/10 of the consensus block, and the eSpace block size is 5/10 of the total gas limit for all eSpace transaction blocks that can be packaged in the corresponding epoch.

Note: The `third` and `seventh` points above will cause changes in the data returned by the RPC, so please take note.

## v2.4.0

This RPC upgrade is primarily to support Conflux 1559 transactions, with the main changes as follows:

### eSpace

#### New RPC

- `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Returns an estimated `maxPriorityFeePerGas` value based on on-chain data.
- `eth_feeHistory`: Returns an array containing the `baseFeePerGas` values of several consecutive blocks, with the block range specifiable by parameters.

#### RPC Updates

Transaction adds fields:

- `type`: 0 - Legacy tx 1 - 2930 tx 2 - 1559 tx
- 2930 tx adds fields: `accessList`, `yParity`
- 1559 tx adds fields: `accessList`, `yParity`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `maxFeePerGas`

Receipt adds fields：

- `type`: 0/1/2
- `burntGasFee`
- `effectiveGasPrice`

The gasUsed field of transaction receipt previously represented gasCharged. Now, it reflects the actual gasUsed. If you previously calculated the transaction gas fee using `gasUsed * gasPrice`, you need to adjust it to `max(gasUsed, 3/4 * gasLimit) * gasPrice`.

Block adds fields：

- `baseFeePerGas`

`eth_call`, `eth_estimate` Request adds fields：

- `type`
- `accessList`
- `maxPriorityPerGas`
- `maxFeePerGas`

#### debug namespace

A new namespace `debug` is added to support debugging features(compatible with Geth debug methods). The following RPCs are included:

- `debug_traceTransaction`: Returns the trace of a transaction.
- `debug_traceBlockByNumber`: Returns the trace of a block.
- `debug_traceBlockByHash`: Returns the trace of a block.
- `debug_traceCall`: Returns the trace of a call.

### Core Space

#### New RPC

- `cfx_maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Returns an estimated `maxPriorityFeePerGas` value based on on-chain data.
- `cfx_feeHistory`: Returns an array containing the `baseFeePerGas` values of several consecutive blocks, with the block range specifiable by parameters.
- `cfx_getFeeBurnt`: Returns the total amount of gas fees burned historically by 1559.

#### RPC Updates

Transaction adds fields：

- `type`: 0 - Legacy tx 1 - 2930 tx 2 - 1559 tx
- 2930 tx adds fields: `accessList`, `yParity`
- 1559 tx adds fields: `accessList`, `yParity`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `maxFeePerGas`

Receipt adds fields:

- `type`: 0/1/2
- `burntGasFee`
- `effectiveGasPrice`

Block adds fields:

- `baseFeePerGas`

`cfx_call`, `cfx_estimate` Request adds fields：

- `type`
- `accessList`
- `maxPriorityPerGas`
- `maxFeePerGas`

`cfx_getParamsFromVote` result adds fields:

- `baseFeeShareProp`

## v2.3.1

- Return `storagePointProp` in cfx_getParamsFromVote, which is introduced by [CIP-107](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/CIPs/blob/master/CIPs/cip-107.md#the-voting-of-proportion).

## v2.3.0

- Add `cfx_getCollateralInfo` to return chain collateral info.
- `cfx_getSponsorInfo` return data add two more fields: `usedStoragePoints` and `availableStoragePoints`. 
- Fix the hex encoding of PoS keys and signatures in pos RPCs.
- Return both compressed and uncompressed BLS public keys in PoS ledger info

## v2.2.5
- Use hex format for `pos` RPC data.
- Add RPC `pos_getLedgerInfoByBlockNumber` and `pos_getLedgerInfoByEpochAndRound` to get PoS ledger infos.
- Add `debug_getEpochReceiptProofByTransaction` to get epoch receipt proof.
- Add `include_eth_recepits` option (default to false) for `cfx_getEpochReceipts`.

## v2.2.4
- Update the `Log` data format returned by cfx filter RPCs.
- Implement `trace_epoch` in the core space RPC endpoint to return traces of two spaces in an epoch.

## v2.2.3
- Add debug RPCs `debug_getTransactionsByEpoch` and `debug_getTransactionsByBlock` to get the original transactions in both spaces atomically. This is only available in the local RPC port and phantom transactions will not be returned.

## v2.2.2

- A new scheme for epoch parameter like [EIP-1898](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1898), which has 3 optional fields:
  - `epochNumber`. Corresponding to `blockNumber`
  - `blockHash`. Same as EIP-1898 `blockHash`
  - `requirePivot`. Corresponding to `requireCanonical`. And according to previous behaviour (including espace `eth_call` and core space `EpochReceipt`), this value will default to `true`
- Add filter RPCs in core space including `cfx_newFilter`, `cfx_newBlockFilter`, `cfx_newPendingTransactionFilter`, `cfx_getFilterChanges`, `cfx_getFilterLogs`, `cfx_uninstallFilter`
- Add a new RPC `pos_getAccountByPowAddress` to get pos account from pow address

## v2.2.1

- Fix `pending` tag behaviour in espace. Now `pending` tag will be considered as `latest` tag except for `eth_getTransactionCount`.
- Fix `cfx_getDepositList` and `cfx_getVoteList` return value format.

## v2.2.0

- Support `safe` and `finalized` block tag in espace.
  - `safe` block number corresponds to `latest_confirmed` and `finalized` corresponds to `latest_finalized`

## v2.1.1

- Add filter RPCs in eSpace including `eth_newFilter`, `eth_newBlockFilter`, `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`, `eth_getFilterLogs`, `eth_getFilterChanges`, `eth_uninstallFilter`

## v2.1.0

- Support `eth_subscribe` and `eth_unsubscribe` in eSpace RPCs.
- Add an RPC method [`cfx_getParamsFromVote`](https://developer.confluxnetwork.org/conflux-doc/docs/json_rpc#cfx_getparamsfromvote) to return the currently used value of the voted parameters.
- Return null for getting skipped transactions and receipts. Whether they will be returned was nondeterministic before, but now they are ensured to be null.
- When querying logs, use LatestState instead of the to epoch number when the to epoch number is greater than LatestState

## v2.0.3

- `cfx_getLogs` and `eth_getLogs` will no longer support the parameters limit and offset. They are not efficient and can be replaced by setting the block/epoch range instead.
- `cfx_clientVersion` will have included more information like `web3_clientVersion` in eSpace.
- `fromEpoch` will default to "latest_state" in `cfx_getLogs`.
- `fromBlock` will default to "latest" in `eth_getLogs`.

## v2.0.2

### eSpace

- Add a new RPC `eth_getAccountPendingTransactions` to get pending transactions by address, also return the first pending transaction's pending reason
- Support WebSockets for eth APIs
- Support block hash param for `eth_call` (EIP1898)
- `eth_call`, `eth_estimate` will respect `from`'s balance if passed, if balance is not enough will return error. If from is not passed then use a random one, which balance will be very big.
- `eth_sendRawTransaction` will reject transaction if sender's balance is not enough, return error like `Transaction {:?} is discarded due to out of balance, needs {:?} but account balance is {:?}`
- If `eth_call`, `eth_estimate` method call raise error, and the `error.data` is string, it will directly return. In version before v2.0.2 they are hex encoded, is not convenient.

### Core Space

- `cfx_call`, `cfx_estimateGasAndCollateral` will respect `from`'s balance if passed, if balance is not enough will return error. If from is not passed then use a random one, which balance will be very big.
- `cfx_sendRawTransaction` will reject transaction if sender's balance is not enough, return error like `Transaction {:?} is discarded due to out of balance, needs {:?} but account balance is {:?}`
- If `cfx_call`, `cfx_estimateGasAndCollateral` method call raise error, and the `error.data` is string, it will directly return. In version before v2.0.2 they are hex encoded, is not convenient.

## v2.0.1

- Report error in `cfx_getLogs` and `eth_getLogs` if `get_logs_filter_max_limit` is configured but the query would return more logs. The previous behavior of `cfx_getLogs` was to silently truncate the result. The previous behavior of `eth_getLogs` was to raise an error when `filter.limit` is too low, regardless of how many logs the query would result in.
- `eth_gasPrice` now estimate gas prices accurately instead of returning a fixed value.
- Support phantom transactions and return correct fields in eSpace `trace` RPCs.
- Add fields `valid` and `createType` for eSpace `trace` RPCs.
- Add RPC `rpc_methods` to return all available methods and `rpc_modules` to return all RPC modules.
- Add `totalEspaceTokens` in the response of `cfx_getSupplyInfo`.
- Add local RPCs `pos_start_voting`, `pos_stop_voting`, and `pos_voting_status`. Check #2438 for details.
