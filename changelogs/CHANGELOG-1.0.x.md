# 1.0.3

## Improvements

- Support `cfx_gasPrice`, `cfx_getAccumulateInterestRate`, `cfx_getInterestRate`, and `cfx_checkBalanceAgainstTransaction` on light nodes.
- Add the following new fields in the return value of `cfx_getTransactionReceipt`: `gasCoveredBySponsor`, `storageCollateralized`, `storageCoveredBySponsor`, `storageReleased`.
- Add new rpc `cfx_getDepositList` and `cfx_getVoteList` in archive/full/light nodes.

# 1.0.2

## Bug Fixes

- Fix bugs in whitelist removal at contract removal.

# 1.0.1

## Light nodes

- Fix the following RPCs on light nodes: `cfx_epochNumber`, `cfx_getNextNonce`, `cfx_GetBlockByHash`, `cfx_getBlockByEpochNumber`, `cfx_getBlockByHashWithPivotAssumption`, `cfx_getBlocksByEpoch`.
- Make `cfx_getTransactionReceipt` return null instead of timeout on light nodes to increase compatibility with js-conflux-sdk.
- Fix bug where light nodes disconnect peers if the user queries the genesis block.
- Add periodic heartbeat messages to the light protocol.

# 1.0.0

## Improvement

- Start stratum services automatically if `mining_author` is set.
Use `mining_type` to allow start CPU mining or disable mining manually.
- block info returned by rpc methods `cfx_getBlockByEpochNumber`, `cfx_getBlockByHash`, `cfx_getBlockByHashWithPivotAssumption` add one new field `gasUsed` (backward compatible)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix bug where users need to restart node before they can use a newly created account to send transactions.
- Fix code() return value for uninitialized contract.
- Fix bug in kill_account after which the contract account is revived by simple transaction.
- Fix missing StorageKey conversion from bytes of DepositList and VoteList.
