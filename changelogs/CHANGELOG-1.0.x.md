# 1.0.0

## Improvement
- Start stratum services automatically if `mining_author` is set. 
Use `mining_type` to allow start CPU mining or disable mining manually.
- block info returned by rpc methods `cfx_getBlockByEpochNumber`, `cfx_getBlockByHash`, `cfx_getBlockByHashWithPivotAssumption` add one new field `gasUsed` (backward compatible)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix bug where users need to restart node before they can use a newly created account to send transactions.
- Fix code() return value for uninitialized contract.
- Fix bug in kill_account after which the contract account is revived by simple transaction.
- Fix missing StorageKey conversion from bytes of DepositList and VoteList.
