# A node is identified by cfxnode://NODEID@PUBLICIP:PORT
# By default, no bootnodes are provided. What's provided here is a list of nodes that Conflux Team maintains across the world.

# ------------------ Storage Parameters ----------------------

# The number of additional snapshot before the current stable checkpoint that we will maintain.
# If it's 0, all snapshot before stable genesis will be deleted and the states are unavailable.
#
# additional_maintained_snapshot_count = 0

# The additional number of epochs to keep different kinds of data before the current era genesis checkpoint.
# For full/light nodes, the default value is 0, meaning all data before the era checkpoint will be removed.
# For archive nodes, the default behavior is keeping all these data, while setting these parameters manually
# will overwrite the default behavior of corresponding data types and garbage collect them accordingly.

# The root directory of all data (block data, state data, and node database).

# The directory to store block-related data.
#
# By default, it is stored under the directory configured with `conflux_data_dir` with the directory name `blockchain_db`.
# If set, the directory path will not be related to `conflux_data_dir` anymore.

# Configure the maximal open MPT count. Open MPTs are maintained as an LRU cache, and we will close the database handle
# for the evicted MPT once its usage finishes. Every MPT contains the data written in 2000 epochs.
# Accessing a state involves opening both its delta MPT and intermediate MPT,
# so setting this to 4 allows to access two states at the same time. A full node always needs one latest state to
# process new epochs, so with the default value we can frequently access one old state (by calling state-related RPCs)
# efficiently without the overhead of opening/closing databases.
#
# Idealy, if the RPC working set involves accessing X state ranges frequently (each range has 2000 epochs),
# this value should be set to 2+2X to avoid thrashing.
# However, increasing the value may increase the system memory usage by opening more database instances at the same
# time, and the memory usage of an MPT is affected by `rocksdb_cache_size`.

# Configure if we strictly check the tx index before garbage collection.
# Setting it to `false` will improve the performance. But if the value is `false`, it's possible that although the

# in an already garbage collected epoch.
