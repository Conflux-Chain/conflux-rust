# bootnodes is a list of nodes that a conflux node trusts, and will be used to sync the blockchain when a node starts. 
# The value is a string divided by comma without space, and every entry is a node
# A node is identified by cfxnode://NODEID@PUBLICIP:PORT
# By default, no bootnodes are provided. What's provided here is a list of nodes that Conflux Team maintains across the world.

# Some preset develepment configurations.
# It should not be set in production environment.
#
# For both `test` and `dev` modes, we will
#     * Set initial difficulty to 4
#     * Allow calling test and debug rpc from public port
#
# `test` mode is for Conflux testing and debugging, we will
#     * Add latency to peer connections
#     * Skip handshake encryption check
#     * Skip header timestamp verification
#     * Handle NewBlockHash even in catch-up mode
#     * Allow data propagation test
#     * Allow setting genesis accounts and generate tx from secrets
#
# `dev` mode is for users to run a single node that automatically
#     generates blocks with fixed intervals
#     * Open port 12536 for tcp rpc if `jsonrpc_tcp_port` is not provided.
#     * Open port 12537 for http rpc if `jsonrpc_http_port` is not provided.
#     * generate blocks automatically without PoW if `start_mining` is false
#     * Skip catch-up mode even there is no peer
