    /// One of the key problem in implementing a cache for tree node is that,
    /// when a node is swapped-out from cache into disk, the eviction of
    /// children should be independent, not only because of cache hit
    /// property, but also because that a node can have multiple parents. When
    /// a node is loaded into cache again, it should automatically connects
    /// to its children in cache, even if the children is shared with some
    /// other node unknown.
    ///
    /// Another problem is that, when a node is swapped-out, the parent's
    /// children reference must be updated unless the children reference is
    /// the db key, or something stable. The db key in Conflux is the
    /// Merkle Hash, which is too large for a Trie node: 16*64B are
    /// required to store only ChildrenTable.
    ///
    /// To solve these problems, we introduce CacheableNodeRef, which should
    /// remain stable for the lifetime of the TrieNode of the
    /// ChildrenTable. The key of NodeRefMap shall be db key, and the value
    /// of NodeRefMap shall point to where the node is cached.
    ///
    /// The db key could be made smaller for Delta MPT (4B)
    /// and maybe for Persistent MPT (8B) by simply using the row number.
    ///
    /// If we have to use Merkle Hash (64B) as db key for Persistent MPT,
    /// storing the key for non-cached node is costly. There are two options,
    /// a) store key only for cached nodes, there is little addition cost (8B),
    /// however to load an un-cached child node from disk, caller should first
    /// read the child's access key by loading the current node, then check
    /// NodeRefMap, if actual missing load it from disk for the second
    /// time.
    /// b) create NodeRef for some children of cached node, store a the 64B key
    /// for disk access, and keep the reference count so that we don't store
    /// NodeRef for nodes which later becomes irrelevant indefinitely.
    ///
    /// Note that there are also dirty nodes, which always live in memory.
    /// The NodeRef / MaybeNodeRef also covers dirty nodes, but NodeRefMap
    /// covers only commited nodes.
